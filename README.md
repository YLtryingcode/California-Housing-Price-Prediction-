# California-Housing-Price-Prediction-
In this project, I will demonstrate the end-to-end process of a machine learning project aiming to be able to find out the pricing pattern. 

In this project, I will be following 8 steps below. The jupyter notebook in this project will include step _ and _ . 
### 1. Frame the problem and look at the big picture.

### 2. Get the data.

### 3. Explore the data to gain insights.

### 4. Prepare the data to better expose the underlying data patterns to machine learning algorithms.

### 5. Explore many different models and shortlist the best ones.

### 6. Fine-tune your models and combine them into a great solution.

### 7. Present your solution.

### 8. Launch, monitor, and maintain your system.
